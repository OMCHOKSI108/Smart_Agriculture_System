# 🌱Smart Agriculture System
# 📌 Overview

The Smart Agriculture System is an IoT-based solution designed to enhance farming efficiency by integrating machine learning, image classification, and smart irrigation. This project enables farmers to:

1. Diagnose plant diseases by uploading leaf images.

2. Automate irrigation based on real-time environmental conditions.

# 🚀 Features

✅ Leaf Disease Detection – AI-based image classification to identify plant diseases from leaf photos.

✅ Smart Irrigation System – Decides whether to irrigate based on temperature and soil moisture levels.

✅ Real-time Monitoring – Tracks temperature, humidity, and soil conditions.
